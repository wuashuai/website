For the Spotify API part:

What's great about AJAX is that you can also use it to make requests 
to external servers/databases.
In order to do so, you can use a company's API (Application Program Interface) 
â€“ a nice way to integrate your website with their information!

APIs will contain all possible endpoints (fancy-speak for the URLs 
your AJAX will make calls to) and they're usually pretty well 
documented. For this task, since we're dealing with music, we'd like to use
Spotify's API. You can check it out here:

Fix the AJAX call so that you can insert the songs and have great music 
while you work :D
